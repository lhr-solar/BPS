Fault Indicator/Strobe Light
=============================
Description
    The strobelight contains 4, 3 watt LED's and is powered by a 12V line. It has 4 wires for setup
    although we only need to use 3. Outside of power and ground, the other 2 wires are for sync and
    pattern. 
Usage    
    The sync wire is if we are using multiple strobelights that must strobe at the same
    time. The pattern wire must be shorted with power if the pattern is to be changed. Once it is 
    set to a pattern, it remembers the pattern with on board flash memory.
Reason
    The strobelight is used to alert other vehicles on the road that the car is dangerous and to 
    avoid it. It is also required under the ASC regulations.
