There are two temperature sensors for each battery module with a module minion board for each of the four rows.
Each board measures up to 12 battery modules and 16 temperature sensors, but is configured for eight modules and 
16 sensors by default.

The Amperes minion board is connected to the main power cable that powers the electrical loop using the :term:`Shunt Resistor`.

Layout 
^^^^^^
**Dimensions: 56mm x 91.46 mm**

Requirements/Constraints:  
    * The e-Ink display acts as a shield and lays on the board, so components with a tall height 
      canâ€™t be placed by the display 
    * The LEDs must be visible and not covered by the e-Ink display 
Design Choices:
    * The parts are organized in sections, with the power distribution system in the bottom left 
      and the CAN connections on the center-right side of the board.  
    * All the logic analyzer pin headers are now separate. They were formerly all in one bigger 
      pin header, but have now been split apart to make traces shorter and neater.  
    * The CAN connectors and car power connectors were placed on the south end of the board so 
      that the wires connecting to them could go through the arm mount.

Leader board
============

The Leader board uses the STM32F413 microcontroller. The board requires seven connectors:

* One 2-pin :ref:`power connector <power-connector>` (+12V, PWRGND)
* One 2-pin error light connector (+12V, PWRGND)
* One 4-pin contactor connector (+12V, PWRGND, aux1, aux2)
* One 4-pin Amperes board connector (+12V, PWRGND, IP, IM)
* One 4-pin CAN connector (isolated +5V, isolated GND, CAN high, CAN low)
* One 2-pin Minion connector (IP, IM)
* One 2x4-pin fan connector (4x +12V, 4x PWRGND)

The STM32F413 requires bypass capacitors and uses an 8MHz clock. To program the STM32F413, pins are connected to a 1x4 header to use the :abbr:`SWD (Serial Wire Debug)` programming protocol. 

The reset button allows you to avoid powering the BPS off to reset it.

.. note::
    You can configure the system to reset every time you use the Keil IDE to program it. 

For more information, see the `STM32F413 datasheet <https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00305666-stm32f413-423-advanced-arm-based-32-bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf>`__.

.. figure:: ../_static/leader-board-diagram.png
    :align: center

    STM32F413 bypass capacitors 

The system's :abbr:`RTC (Real Time Clock)` is sourced from a low-power crystal oscillator. The crystal is used to set the :abbr:`PLL (Phase Lock Loop)`, which 
sets the system core frequency (CPU clock speed). The controller supports a range of frequencies, but the default is 8MHz. 

The :abbr:`MCU (Microcontroller Unit)` has an alternate internal clock that saves power consumption at the cost of precision. 
Since this system is safety critical, the external 8MHz crystal was added. 

.. note::
    The internal and external clocks were not tested against each other.

Capacitor values are set based on the crystalâ€™s load capacitance and the capacitance of the whole board. 
The crystal and capacitor should be as physically close to the MCU as possible to avoid signal drift.

.. _power-connector:

Power connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Leader board gets a 12V power supply. The voltage must be dropped to power the MCU and components. The total voltage required for all the components is +3.3V and +5V. 

An isolated DC-DC converter (RI3-1205S) converts the +12V input to +5V. The +12V input will be isolated from the +5V output. The Leader board
must use the correct grounds to maintain isolation. 

A switching regulator (NCP1117) converts the +5V input to +3.3V. This does not need isolation because the +5V input and corresponding grounds are already isolated from the +12V line.

Fan Board: Manthan Upadhyaya
=============================

Purpose
    The purpose of this board is to set the speed of the fans that will be used to cool the battery 
    pack. It recieves signals from the Master Board and sends them across a MOSFET that switches the 
    fan on or off.

Blocks
    Mosfets - Each mosfet is between the power provided by the Master Board and power provided to the
    fans. When the PWM signal is set, it switches the fan on or off at a certain duty cycle.

Connections
    6 Connector: 4 of these connections are the PWM signals sent by the Master board. The other 2
    are power and ground.
    
    2 Connector(4): These are the power and grounds each fan is connected to.

Additional Considerations
    None
