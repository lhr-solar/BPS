Requirements/Constraints:  
    * The HX1188FNL needs to be isolated, as in it cannot be placed on a GND or Power layer. 
      So a keep-out area was used around the HX1188FNL.    
    * Connectors must be placed on opposite sides of the board. This will allow all the connections to fit on the board.   

Design Choices:    
    * The board was kept at a small size to conserve space  
    
Fan Board
=========

Overview
^^^^^^^^
`GitHub Link <https://github.com/lhr-solar/BPS-FanPCB>`__

Brief Description/Purpose:
    The purpose of this board is to set the speed of the fans that will be used to cool the battery 
    pack. It receives signals from the Leader Board and sends them across a :term:`MOSFET <MOSFET>` that switches 
    the fan on or off. This board can also be used to interface with other high current driving peripherals.

Leader board
============

Connectors
^^^^^^^^^^
The Leader board uses the STM32F413 microcontroller. The board requires seven connectors:

* One 2-pin :ref:`power connector <power-connector>` (+12V, PWRGND)
* One 2-pin error light connector (+12V, PWRGND)
* One 4-pin contactor connector (+12V, PWRGND, aux1, aux2)
* One 4-pin Amperes board connector (+12V, PWRGND, IP, IM)
* One 4-pin CAN connector (isolated +5V, isolated GND, CAN high, CAN low)
* One 2-pin Minion connector (IP, IM)
* One 2x4-pin fan connector (4x +12V, 4x PWRGND)

    Leader Board Block Diagram 

Microcontroller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The :term:`STM32F413 <STM>` requires bypass capacitors and uses an 8MHz clock. To program the STM32F413, pins are 
connected to a 1x4 header to use the :term:`SWD <SWD>` programming protocol. 

The reset button allows you to avoid powering the BPS off to reset it.

.. note::
    You can configure the system to reset every time you use the Keil IDE to program it. 

For more information, see the `STM32F413 datasheet <https://www.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00305666-stm32f413-423-advanced-arm-based-32-bit-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf>`__.

.. figure:: ../_static/leader-board-diagram.png
    :align: center

    STM32F413 bypass capacitors 

Clock
^^^^^
The system's :abbr:`RTC (Real Time Clock)` is sourced from a low-power crystal oscillator. The crystal 
is used to set the :term:`PLL <Phase Locked Loop>`, which sets the system core frequency (CPU clock 
speed). The controller supports a range of frequencies, but the default is 8MHz. 

The :abbr:`MCU (Microcontroller Unit)` has an alternate internal clock that saves power consumption 
at the cost of precision. Since this system is safety critical, the external 8MHz crystal was added. 

.. note::
    The internal and external clocks were not tested against each other.

Capacitors
^^^^^^^^^^
Capacitor values are set based on the crystalâ€™s load capacitance and the capacitance of the whole 
board. The crystal and capacitor should be as physically close to the MCU as possible to avoid signal drift.

.. _power-connector:

Power connector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Leader board gets a 12V power supply. The voltage must be dropped to power the MCU and components. 
The total voltage required for all the components is +3.3V and +5V. 

DC-DC converter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An isolated DC-DC converter (RI3-1205S) converts the +12V input to +5V. The +12V input will be 
isolated from the +5V output. The Leader board must use the correct grounds to maintain isolation. 

A switching regulator (NCP1117) converts the +5V input to +3.3V. This does not need isolation because 
the +5V input and corresponding grounds are already isolated from the +12V line.

Voltage & Temperature Minion Board
==================================

Overview
^^^^^^^^
`GitHub Link <https://github.com/lhr-solar/BPS-MinionPCB>`__

Brief Description/Purpose: 
    There are temperature sensors within the battery pack attached to each module (the number of which could 
    based on the design). Each board measures up to 12 battery modules and 16 temperature sensors. The 
    temperature sensors are placed as inputs to a mux and the mux switches between all of them.

BPS Scrutineering Board
=======================

Overview
^^^^^^^^
`GitHub Link <https://github.com/lhr-solar/BPS-ScrutineeringPCB>`__

Brief Description/Purpose:
    This board will be used during the scrutineering process for the American Solar Challenge race. 
    It will be used to demonstrate that the BPS is functional by proving that the BPS executes the 
    appropriate measures in an overvoltage and undervoltage state. The battery modules will be connected to the  
    BPS Minion Boards through this board. The board will be connected to an external power supply, which 
    will be used to simulate a normal, overvoltage, and undervoltage state. This board will induce an overvoltage 
    and undervoltage state to trigger the BPS without affecting the batteries. It will also contain fuses to prevent
    the Minion boards from being damaged in the event that the testing is done improperly.
