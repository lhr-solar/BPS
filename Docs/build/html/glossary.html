<dt id="term-low-pass-filter">Low-Pass Filter</dt>
<dd>Removes high-frequency components from signals. Often used to reduce noise.</dd>
<dt id="term-mosfet">MOSFET</dt>

<dd>A maximum power point tracker (MPPT) monitors the power output of a solar array and attempts to maximize that power by adjusting a load (resistance) on that power line.</dd>
<dt id="term-mutex">Mutex</dt>
<dd>A signal that is used to indicate that a thread is using a resource. In multithreaded programming, race conditions become issues. To solve these, a flag is raised each time a resource needs to be accessed, and is unset whenever that resource becomes free for other threads to use. These are typically managed by an operating system or a mediator.</dd>
<dt id="term-negative-logic">Negative Logic</dt>
<dd>Logical 1/true is a low voltage/off and a logic 0/false is a high voltage/on.</dd>
<dt id="term-ngm">NGM</dt>
<dd>New Generation Motors is a company that makes highly efficient motors. We have used their motors in the past, and often use “the NGM” to refer to the motor that we have in the lab.</dd>
<dt id="term-open-drain-collector">Open Drain/Collector</dt>
<dd>A configuration of a pin on a microcontroller where typically logical ‘0’ corresponds to ‘0V’ while logical ‘1’ corresponds to a high impedance state (Hi-Z). This is often used to allow multiple devices to share a single wire for communication. This stands in opposition to a “push-pull” configuration.</dd>
<dt id="term-positive-logic">Positive Logic</dt>
<dd>Logical 1/true is a high voltage/on and a logic 0/false is a low voltage/false.</dd>
<dt id="term-pull-down-resistor">Pull-Down Resistor</dt>
<dd>A resistor to gnd that pulls a wire’s voltage to logical ‘0’ when it disconnects from some other source.</dd>
<dt id="term-pull-up-resistor">Pull-Up Resistor</dt>
<dd>A resistor to Vcc that pulls a wire’s voltage to logical ‘1’ when it disconnects from some other source.</dd>
<dt id="term-push-pull">Push-Pull</dt>
<dd>A configuration of a pin on a microcontroller where typically logical ‘0’ corresponds to 0V, which logical ‘1’ corresponds to the operating voltage (Vcc). Using this configuration, there can only be one source on a wire that drives communication/control. It stands in opposition to an “open drain” configuration.</dd>
<dt id="term-queue">Queue</dt>
<dd>A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure, where typically supported operations are to insert elements (queue/push), take elements out (dequeue/pop), and view the front element (peek). Elements are removed in the same order that they were entered.</dd>
<dt id="term-race-condition">Race Condition</dt>
<dd>An issue that occurs when multiple threads are attempting to access the same resources. For example, if one thread performs an operation on some data that takes the form read-modify-writeback, and another thread writes to that data after the first read, but before it modifies and writes back. This could potentially put the program in an unaccounted-for state. This issue can be addressed with mutexes and semaphores.</dd>
<dt id="term-register">Register</dt>
<dd>Basic unit of memory. Temporarily holds important data.</dd>
<dt id="term-rtos">RTOS</dt>
<dd>A real-time operating system. These typically manage threads in a way that requires each thread to cede control back to the operating system, rather than allowing the OS to interrupt the thread. This ensures that communications and other critical paths are not interrupted partway through completion. These may or may not include other features like file systems, networking stacks, and memory management systems.</dd>
<dt id="term-semaphore">Semaphore</dt>
<dd>A variable that tracks the availability of a  resource. Threads will look here before attempting to access resources in order to avoid race conditions, and will set/unset or increment/decrement these when they acquire/release the resources.</dd>
<dt id="term-silkscreen">Silkscreen</dt>
<dd>Ink layer on a PCB for all the text and graphics</dd>
<dt id="term-smd">SMD</dt>
<dd>A surface mount device (also called surface-mount-component) is a device that is soldered to the surface of a PCB, as opposed to a through-hole component.</dd>
<dt id="term-soc">SOC</dt>
<dd>A system on a chip is a microprocessor with flash memory, ram, and any other necessary system components integrated in the single chip.</dd>
<dt id="term-spi">SPI</dt>
<dd>The serial-peripheral-interface is a de-facto standard interface between a microcontroller and one or several  peripheral devices. This uses allows for one supervisor device, which initiates all communications, and several worker devices, which share data and clock lines, but each require their own chip-select lines, which indicate which is required to listen/respond to the supervisor.</dd>
<dt id="term-stack">Stack</dt>
<dd>A First-In-Last-Out structure, where the supported options are push (add element), pop (remove element), and peek (look at top element). The typical analogy is a stack of paper, where each page is added individually to the top and each piece is individually removed from the top. This may also refer to a region of memory in a computer that is used to store parameters to functions, local variables, and the state of the calling function.</dd>
<dt id="term-step-down">Step-Down</dt>
<dd>A reduction in voltage</dd>
<dt id="term-step-up">Step-Up</dt>
<dd>An increase in voltage</dd>
<dt id="term-st-link">ST-Link</dt>
<dd>STM’s interface for programming and debugging their microcontrollers, or the device that uses that interface.</dd>
<dt id="term-stm">STM</dt>
<dd>STMicroelectronics is a company that produces various silicon chips and sensors. We also often refer to various microcontrollers produced by STMicro as STMs, since all their part IDs begin STM…</dd>
<dt id="term-swd">SWD</dt>
<dd>Tightly coupled with ST-Link, the protocol that STM uses debugging.</dd>
<dt id="term-switching-regulator">Switching Regulator</dt>
<dd>A regulator that boosts or bucks the voltage by fast internal switching mechanisms. The switching (which usually a MOSFET toggling) introduces some noise to the system, but is typically more power efficient than a linear regulator and allows for boosting as well as bucking.</dd>
<dt id="term-thick-film-resistor">Thick-Film Resistor</dt>
<dd>A type of resistor that is relatively easy to manufacture, making it very cheap. The ‘thick-film’ refers to the internal structure that gives it its resistance.</dd>
<dt id="term-thin-film-resistor">Thin-Film Resistor</dt>
<dd>A type of resistor that is a bit harder to manufacture than a thick-film resistor, making it slightly more expensive. It typically has lower tolerances and parasitic capacitance/inductance, making it useful for high-precision circuits.</dd>
<dt id="term-through-hole">Through-Hole</dt>
<dd>A type of component that has leads that poke through holes on the PCB and are then soldered, usually from the side of the PCB that is opposite the actual component. It contrasts SMD components.</dd>
<dt id="term-tritium">Tritium</dt>
<dd>A brand of 3-phase motor controller that our team uses.</dd>
<dt id="term-uart">UART</dt>
<dd>An asynchronous communications protocol between two chips.</dd>
